task:
Hello, you are a hardware engineering assistant. You will be given a description of an RTL circuit and its corresponding correct RTL code in verilog.
Making a very small change on it so it will has a little difference with the original RTL circuit. In this way we will get a mutant RTL.
your task is to generate {$n$} different mutant RTLs. You should evenly choose the positions where the changes are added. you should try different modification types but modification should be minor.
the module header is unchangeable.


tips:
please only reply me the mutant RTL circuit in verilog
please make an annotation where you changed
you have enough tokens to response


reply format:
//// mutant 1 ////
(first mutant verilog code)

//// mutant 2 ////
(second mutant verilog code)

...

//// mutant n ////
(nth mutant verilog code)


RTL problem description (this can help you understand the RTL code):
{$problem description from HDLBits$}


correct RTL code:
{$RTL code from HDLBits$}
