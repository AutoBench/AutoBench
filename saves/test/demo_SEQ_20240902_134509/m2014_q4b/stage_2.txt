You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement a D flip flop, positive edge triggered, with an asynchronous reset "ar".
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Module Name: 'top_module' - The module to be tested is named 'top_module'. This information is critical for identifying the correct module in the testbench.",
    "2. DUT Inputs: - 'clk' (Clock Input): The testbench must generate a clock signal simulating the positive edge triggering of the flip flop. - 'd' (Data Input): The testbench should provide various data inputs (0 and 1) to test the functionality of the D flip flop. - 'ar' (Asynchronous Reset): The testbench should test the asynchronous reset functionality by switching this signal at irregular intervals and without synchronizing it to the clock.",
    "3. DUT Output: - 'q' (Output): The main output that needs to be captured and checked against expected values after applying different input combinations and under various operational scenarios (e.g., during and after the reset).",
    "4. Clock Signal Handling: The testbench should simulate a realistic clock signal to correctly trigger the positive edge dependency of the flip flop. Different clock frequencies and edge cases like glitches or irregular clock pulses should also be tested to ensure robustness.",
    "5. Reset Functionality Test: It is critical to verify the behavior of the flip flop during and after an asynchronous reset. Testing should include how the flip flop responds to 'ar' being toggled high and low at various points of the clock cycle and D input value stability.",
    "6. Data Dependency Verification: The test cases should confirm that the output 'q' correctly reflects the input 'd' at the rising edge of the clock when the reset 'ar' is low. This checks the fundamental data storage feature of the flip flop.",
    "7. Test completeness: The test set must cover normal cases (sequential input values) and edge cases including rapid toggling of D and ar to ensure the DUT can handle real-world operational stresses."

DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input d,
	input ar,
	output logic q

{
  "scenario 1": "Apply a stable clock at a regular interval. Start with asynchronous reset 'ar' active (high) initially, then deactivate (low) after clock cycle 5. Maintain data input 'd' at low (0) throughout this period.",
  "scenario 2": "Stable clock at regular intervals. Set 'ar' low (inactive) throughout. Toggle 'd' from low (0) to high (1) at the rising edge of clock cycle 3.",
  "scenario 3": "Generate a stable clock. 'ar' should be toggled from low to high and back to low between successive clock cycles without alignment to the clock edges. Keep 'd' constant at high (1) during these toggles.",
  "scenario 4": "Apply a stable clock. With 'ar' low (inactive), alternate 'd' input between low (0) and high (1) on each rising edge of the clock to test the D flip flop's behaviour.",
  "scenario 5": "Introduce a clock glitch or irregular pulse (e.g., shorter pulse duration) at cycle 4. 'ar' remains low and 'd' at high. Verify handling of clock irregularities.",
  "scenario 6": "Stable clock, with 'ar' active (high) first, then switching to low after clock cycle 2. Transition 'd' from high (1) to low (0) precisely at the rising edge of the clock when 'ar' turns low.",
  "scenario 7": "With a regularly timed clock, set 'ar' to high and drop it back to low between the falling edge of clock cycle 2 and rising edge of clock cycle 3. Keep 'd' low (0) during this test scenario."
