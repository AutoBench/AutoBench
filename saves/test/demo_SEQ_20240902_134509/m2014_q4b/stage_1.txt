You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement a D flip flop, positive edge triggered, with an asynchronous reset "ar".
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input d,
	input ar,
	output logic q
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Module Name: 'top_module' - The module to be tested is named 'top_module'. This information is critical for identifying the correct module in the testbench.",
    "2. DUT Inputs: - 'clk' (Clock Input): The testbench must generate a clock signal simulating the positive edge triggering of the flip flop. - 'd' (Data Input): The testbench should provide various data inputs (0 and 1) to test the functionality of the D flip flop. - 'ar' (Asynchronous Reset): The testbench should test the asynchronous reset functionality by switching this signal at irregular intervals and without synchronizing it to the clock.",
    "3. DUT Output: - 'q' (Output): The main output that needs to be captured and checked against expected values after applying different input combinations and under various operational scenarios (e.g., during and after the reset).",
    "4. Clock Signal Handling: The testbench should simulate a realistic clock signal to correctly trigger the positive edge dependency of the flip flop. Different clock frequencies and edge cases like glitches or irregular clock pulses should also be tested to ensure robustness.",
    "5. Reset Functionality Test: It is critical to verify the behavior of the flip flop during and after an asynchronous reset. Testing should include how the flip flop responds to 'ar' being toggled high and low at various points of the clock cycle and D input value stability.",
    "6. Data Dependency Verification: The test cases should confirm that the output 'q' correctly reflects the input 'd' at the rising edge of the clock when the reset 'ar' is low. This checks the fundamental data storage feature of the flip flop.",
    "7. Test completeness: The test set must cover normal cases (sequential input values) and edge cases including rapid toggling of D and ar to ensure the DUT can handle real-world operational stresses."
