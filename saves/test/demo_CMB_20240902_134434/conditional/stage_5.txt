You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. background: Your task is to verify the functional correctness of a verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). Our plan is to first export the signals (input and output) of the DUT under test scenarios. Then, we will use a python script to check the correctness of DUT.
2. You are in the last stage. In this stage, we already export the signals of DUT. Your task is to write a python script. The python script contains one main function "check_dut" and other functions to be called by "check_dut" (this is optional). The input of "check_dut" is the signals of DUT in the format below: (the signal names are real, but the values are just for example)
[{'scenario': '1', 'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0, 'min': 0}, {'scenario': '2', 'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0, 'min': 0}]
The main function "check_dut" should check the correctness according to the input signals. The input signals are all in decimal format. It will be called by other codes later.
3. Your python scritp should contain a function "check_dut", its header is "def check_dut(test_vectors:list) -> bool:". It can also call other functions you write in this script. If all test scenarios passed, function "check_dut" should return an empty list [], otherwise it should return the list of failed scenarios indexes. You can use binary (like 0x1101), hexadecimal (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python. 
4. You have the information below to help you check the correctness of DUT:

RTL circuit problem description:
Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
Checker specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The Device Under Test (DUT) is defined as a module named 'top_module'.",
    "2. The DUT accepts four 8-bit unsigned input numbers: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.",
    "3. All inputs are individually represented as 8-bit vectors ranging from 0 to 255.",
    "4. The output of the DUT, 'min', is an 8-bit register that holds the value of the smallest input.",
    "5. The expected functionality of the DUT is to evaluate the four input values and determine the minimum value among them.",
    "6. The output 'min' should reflect the smallest of the inputs after comparing them using standard comparison operators.",
    "7. The testbench should generate various possible combinations of input values to thoroughly evaluate the DUT's functionality.",
    "8. Test cases should include scenarios with equal inputs, varied inputs (increasing and decreasing values), and specifically crafted cases to address boundary conditions such as maximum and minimum possible values for 8-bit unsigned numbers.",
    "9. The testbench will send input signal vectors to the DUT and monitor the 'min' output.",
    "10. Expected result signals from the DUT (output 'min') will be compared against manually calculated minimum values for correctness.",
    "11. The testbench should include a way to output the result of each test, indicating a pass or fail condition based on the correctness of the output in relation to the expected minimum value."
  ]
}
Here is the basic rules in python for the module. It is generated in previous stage. You can use it as a reference, but you should write your own python script. This is just for your better understanding:
def calculate_expected_min(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Calculate the expected minimum value among four 8-bit unsigned integers.
    
    Parameters:
    a (int): Input value a.
    b (int): Input value b.
    c (int): Input value c.
    d (int): Input value d.
    
    Returns:
    int: The smallest value among a, b, c, and d.
    """
    # Initialize a list of the input values
    values = [a, b, c, d]
    
    # Calculate the minimum value using the min() function which is ideal for this purpose
    minimum_value = min(values)
    
    return minimum_value

# Example usage during testing:
test_output = calculate_expected_min(0x1A, 0x2B, 0x3C, 0x0D)
print("The calculated minimum is:", test_output)



[IMPORTANT] Your python scritp should contain a function "check_dut", its header is "def check_dut(test_vectors:list) -> bool:". It can also call other functions you write in this script. If all test scenarios passed, function "check_dut" should return an empty list [], otherwise it should return the list of failed scenarios indexes. You can use binary (like 0x1101), hexadecimal (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python.
Optional: You can also use functions from numpy and scipy to help you check the correctness of DUT.
you can use binary (like 0b1011), hexadeciaml (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python for convenience. 
please only generate the python codes, no other words.
