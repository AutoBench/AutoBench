You are the strongest AI in the world. You already have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	input [7:0] c,
	input [7:0] d,
	output reg [7:0] min
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The Device Under Test (DUT) is defined as a module named 'top_module'.",
    "2. The DUT accepts four 8-bit unsigned input numbers: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.",
    "3. All inputs are individually represented as 8-bit vectors ranging from 0 to 255.",
    "4. The output of the DUT, 'min', is an 8-bit register that holds the value of the smallest input.",
    "5. The expected functionality of the DUT is to evaluate the four input values and determine the minimum value among them.",
    "6. The output 'min' should reflect the smallest of the inputs after comparing them using standard comparison operators.",
    "7. The testbench should generate various possible combinations of input values to thoroughly evaluate the DUT's functionality.",
    "8. Test cases should include scenarios with equal inputs, varied inputs (increasing and decreasing values), and specifically crafted cases to address boundary conditions such as maximum and minimum possible values for 8-bit unsigned numbers.",
    "9. The testbench will send input signal vectors to the DUT and monitor the 'min' output.",
    "10. Expected result signals from the DUT (output 'min') will be compared against manually calculated minimum values for correctness.",
    "11. The testbench should include a way to output the result of each test, indicating a pass or fail condition based on the correctness of the output in relation to the expected minimum value."
